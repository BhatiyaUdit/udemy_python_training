"""
What is Cpython?
    Implementation of python itself

    Python itself is a language. A language is a set of rules.
    These rules should be interpreted by a software that understands that language.
    This software is usually called an "implementation".
    There are many implementations of Python, but the main one is CPython.
    CPython is written in C language.
    In fact, the software you download from python.org is CPython and CPython has been
     programmed to understand Python language.
