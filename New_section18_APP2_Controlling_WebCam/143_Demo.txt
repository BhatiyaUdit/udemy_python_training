going to build is a program that

detects objects, moving objects in front of a computer webcam and then what it

does it record the time that the object enters the webcam, so the video frame

and the time when the object exited the video frame, so now there is a moving

object in frame and if I go away you see that there's no green rectangle now in

the video.
