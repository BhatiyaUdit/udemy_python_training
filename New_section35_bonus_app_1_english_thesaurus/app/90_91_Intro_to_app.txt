90 How the output will look like

    User will be asked to enter a word through command line
    IF the word is present in data set
        Op-> will be the definition(s) of the word

    IF the user enters partially matching word then (ex Rainn)
        Prompt if you mean "rain" ? Y is yes , N  is no\

    IF the word is some random text (ex aaaaddkdfkfmd)
        Op-> word not found

    Do not apply case sensitivity on user input
