We are going to use Jupyter in the next videos. Just to refresh your memory,
Jupyter can be started by running the following command on your terminal:

jupyter notebook

That will start Jupyter Notebook on your internet browser.

If the above command doesn't work, try the alternative:

On Windows:

py -3.9 -m jupyter notebook

On Mac:

python3.9 -m jupyter notebook
