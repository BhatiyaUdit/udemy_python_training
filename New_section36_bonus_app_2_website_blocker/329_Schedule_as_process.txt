To Schedule the program as background process "WINDOWS"

We need to run the python file in windows with pythonw.exe instead python.exe

shortcut to achieve the same is to rename the file to .pyw instead of .py

By double-clicking the file it will run the file in the background process

Note ::: DO NOT GIVE RELATIVE PATH TO THE FILE
        ,DO NOT GIVE TEMP PATH USED

Final Step :
    Schedule the background process:
    Open Task Scheduler
        Create Task
            Provide Name = website blocker
            Configure for = Windows 10 From dropdown
            Run with the highest privilege check box checked --Needed to run as Admin otherwise Permission error

        Trigger Tab
            New
            Begin the task -> At Startup

        Actions Tab
            New
            Start a Program
            Browse *.pyw file

        Conditions Tab
            uncheck Start the task when computer is on AC power

    To check -> Manually run -> if present in Task Manager as background process --- SUCCESS!!
