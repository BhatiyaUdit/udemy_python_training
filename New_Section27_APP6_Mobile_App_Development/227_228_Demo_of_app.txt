Mobile App development
    Feel Good app that will take feeling as input and
    give quote based on the feeling


    App will work on Android, IOS and Desktops

    Library used kivy -> pip install kivy

    File name to run mobile app should be main.py


    229 Notes:
        To create an app using kivy there are two ways
            1       Write all code in python
            2       Write UI in Kivy language and logic in python

        To use Kivy language we need to create design.kv file and use that to create UI

        in python file
        we need to import App from kivy.app
        from kivy.lang import Builder
        from kivy.uix.screenmanager import ScreenManager, Screen

        Load the kv file

        Write empty classes that map to Screen in kv file (exact Name)
        Write MAinApp CLass inherit from App

        Run the APP conditionally of the class name is main
